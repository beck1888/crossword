From round 1 feedback:

Nice first cut.  Quick review notes:
Word numbering is weird - should be top, left to right

Some word truncation observed. In my 40 word test, note on right side VEGET should be VEGETABLE. And BRAD should be BRADY.

Input error handling - good: it seems to prevent words with spaces or hyphen, bad: it doesn’t give an error message alerting user to the problem

Word placement appearance improves with larger word count, which makes sense. See 40 word screenshot attached. 

Haven’t tried printing yet, but clue spacing may be taking too much room- see attached print dialog screenshot

Should we add a 5 digit random number (matching) on each puzzle and game so that teachers who save them, can keep them matched up?
